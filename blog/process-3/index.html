To perform the operation, relative motion is required between the tool and the work. This relative motion is achieved in most machining operation by means of a primary motion, called &ldquo;cutting speed&rdquo; and a secondary motion called &ldquo;feed&rdquo;.[7] The shape of the tool and its penetration into the work surface, combined with these motions, produce the desired shape of the resulting work surface.</p><h2 id=machining-operations>Machining operations</h2><p>There are many kinds of machining operations, each of which is capable of generating a certain part geometry and surface texture.</p><p>In turning, a cutting tool with a single cutting edge is used to remove material from a rotating workpiece to generate a cylindrical shape. The primary motion is provided by rotating the workpiece, and the feed motion is achieved by moving the cutting tool slowly in a direction parallel to the axis of rotation of the workpiece.</p><p>Drilling is used to create a round hole. It is accomplished by a rotating tool that typically has two or four helical cutting edges. The tool is fed in a direction parallel to its axis of rotation into the workpiece to form the round hole.</p><p>In boring, a tool with a single bent pointed tip is advanced into a roughly made hole in a spinning workpiece to slightly enlarge the hole and improve its accuracy. It is a fine finishing operation used in the final stages of product manufacture.</p><p>Reaming is one of the sizing operations that removes a small amount of metal from a hole already drilled.</p><p>In milling, a rotating tool with multiple cutting edges is moved slowly relative to the material to generate a plane or straight surface. The direction of the feed motion is perpendicular to the tool&rsquo;s axis of rotation. The speed motion is provided by the rotating milling cutter. The two basic forms of milling are:</p><ul><li>Peripheral milling</li><li>Face milling.</li></ul><p>Other conventional machining operations include shaping, planing, broaching and sawing. Also, grinding and similar abrasive operations are often included within the category of machining.</p><p>Content from <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machining>wikipedia</a>.</p></div></main></div><div id=related><h2>More from studio waslo</h2><ul class=posts><li class=post><div class=hover-opacity><a href=https://www.studiowaslo.com/blog/process-2/><div class=cover><img alt="Our Manufacturing Process Part II" loading=lazy src=https://www.studiowaslo.com/blog/process-2/cover_hu2ffad51294c12bb5620084491796e85c_272137_1000x0_resize_q75_box.jpg></div><h2 class="title fs-primary-heading fw-bold">Our Manufacturing Process Part II</h2></a></div><div class=fs-secondary-heading><div class=authors-list><a class="author-link hover-opacity author-default-author" href=/authors/default-author>Default Author</a></div><h3>January 2, 2019</h3></div></li><li class=post><div class=hover-opacity><a href=https://www.studiowaslo.com/blog/process-1/><div class=cover><img alt="Our Manufacturing Process Part I" loading=lazy src=https://www.studiowaslo.com/blog/process-1/cover_hu8f8e1bfda069c7a1b75f77464cdd1ac7_859432_1000x0_resize_q75_box.jpg></div><h2 class="title fs-primary-heading fw-bold">Our Manufacturing Process Part I</h2></a></div><div class=fs-secondary-heading><div class=authors-list><a class="author-link hover-opacity author-default-author" href=/authors/default-author>Default Author</a></div><h3>January 1, 2019</h3></div></li><li class=post><div class=hover-opacity><a href=https://www.studiowaslo.com/blog/building-squares/><div class=cover><img alt="Building Squares" loading=lazy src=https://www.studiowaslo.com/blog/building-squares/cover_hu3da72d97dae931970831d68d7af702d0_222820_1000x0_resize_q75_box.jpg></div><h2 class="title fs-primary-heading fw-bold">Building Squares</h2></a></div><div class=fs-secondary-heading><div class=authors-list><a class="author-link hover-opacity author-default-author" href=/authors/default-author>Default Author</a></div></div></li></ul></div><footer class="container primary-footer"><hr><div class=content><nav><ul role=list class=nav-list><li class=hover-opacity><a href=/blog/>Blog</a></li><li class=hover-opacity><a href=/categories/>Categories</a></li></ul></nav><div>Copyright Â© studio waslo.</div></div></footer></body></html>
